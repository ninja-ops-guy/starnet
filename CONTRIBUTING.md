## AeroTech Staff addendum

### Asset replacement rule

Every texture, sprite, sound, or brand asset committed to `frontend/assets/`,
`src-tauri/icons/`, or `src-tauri/installer/` must have a corresponding entry in
[`ASSET-MANIFEST.md`](ASSET-MANIFEST.md) before the PR is merged.

Required per entry:
- **Source path**: where the asset originated (e.g. `techops-hero/assets/campaign/...`)
- **Source commit**: the exact commit SHA in the source repo
- **SHA-256**: hash of the file as committed to this repo
- **Status**: `pending` / `verified` / `generated` / `preserved`

AI-generated assets must include a `.gen.md` sidecar with the exact prompt,
seed, and model version used.

Run `npm run asset-check` before submitting a PR that touches assets.

### Rebrand script usage

When making user-facing string changes, prefer the automated rebrand script
over manual edits to avoid missing occurrences:

```bash
npm run rebrand -- --dry-run   # preview
npm run rebrand                # apply
```

The script only touches user-facing strings (titles, labels, alt text) and
deliberately skips code identifiers to minimize breakage.

# Contributing to StarNet (upstream guidelines — preserved)

Thanks for helping improve StarNet. Bug fixes, tests, documentation, accessibility work, and
carefully scoped features are welcome.

## Before you start

- Search existing issues and pull requests before opening a duplicate.
- For a substantial feature or architecture change, open an issue first so the scope and safety
  model can be agreed before implementation.
- Report security vulnerabilities privately using [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), never in a public
  issue.
- Follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Development setup

Node.js 22 is recommended because it matches CI and the release train.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/androoAGI/starnet.git
cd starnet
npm ci
npm run test:fast
```

The Node sidecar itself has no runtime npm dependencies and can be started with
`node sidecar/index.js`. Desktop development additionally requires Rust and the
[Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/).

## Pull-request workflow

1. Fork the repository and create a focused branch from the current default branch.
2. Keep the change narrow; do not mix unrelated formatting or generated artifacts into it.
3. Add or update tests for behavior changes.
4. Run `npm run test:fast`. Run `npm run test:http` when changing routes, streaming, persistence,
   providers, tools, schedules, channels, or other sidecar integration paths.
5. Use a clear Conventional Commit-style title such as `fix(sidecar): reject stale consent`.
6. Explain what changed, why it is safe, and how you verified it in the pull request.

Do not commit credentials, local workspaces, QA captures, installers, or generated release
artifacts. Run `npm run security:secrets` before submitting if you have Gitleaks installed.

## Project laws

- Only claim behavior that was verified in the live app.
- The interface must never assert state the harness cannot prove.
- Permission escalation defaults to deny and destructive actions require explicit consent.
- `shared/events.js` and `shared/schema.js` are additive contracts: do not rename or remove existing
  events or fields without an approved migration.
- Keep secrets in the sidecar or native credential store; never send them to the renderer or logs.

## Repository layout

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `frontend/` | Station UI and renderer. |
| `sidecar/` | Agent runtime and local authority. |
| `shared/` | Cross-boundary schemas and events. |
| `src-tauri/` | Desktop shell. |
| `test/` | Test gates. |
| `qa/` | Live verification and release receipts. |
| `aerotech/` | **AeroTech Staff add-on:** RESIDUAL Command Station adapter. |

Maintainers and automated coding agents working in the shared local integration environment
follow an internal worktree protocol (local tooling, not part of this repository); external
contributors can use a normal fork-and-pull-request workflow.
